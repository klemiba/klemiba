ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Klemen Babuder (@klemiba)!

I'm an **XR developer** at Art Rebel 9 and a masters student at the University of Ljubljana, currently located in Ljubljana, Slovenija. 

I'm fasctinated by XR and am working mostly with Unity3D and Hololens 2.

I previously worked as a student developer on an app called KulTura (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ltfe.kultura&hl=sl&gl=US), 
where I mostly developed for android and was in charge of the AR features of the application.

These days I spend most of my time developing the MR HoloLens 2 app for the ARGO Platform (https://argoxr.io/), a mixed reality management and maintenance platform for large infrastructural and industrial environments.

You can find demos of some of my previous work and student projects on my youtube channel -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0EE5BmN3-w
